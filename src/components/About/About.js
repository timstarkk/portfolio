                <p>I recently earned a certificate in Full-Stack Web Development from The University of Texas at Austin. Since graduating I have continued to grow my JavaScript and React.js skills, as well as gaining hands on experience with AWS cloud technologies. Through online courses, I have also gained a strong understanding of development  fundamentals, such as data structures and algorithms. I am currently working on a real-world React.js B2B application, as well as creating my first React Native app using Expo. I have also begun to contribute to open source projects.
